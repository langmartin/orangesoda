* Emacs in Javascript & the DOM
by [[file:lang.org][Lang]] [2009-10-31 Sat]

Quixotic, embryonic.

* Components
** Elisp Interpreter
*** Reader
**** Sexp
**** Vector
**** Quasiquote
**** Character
**** Number
*** Dynamic Scope
*** Data Types
*** Elisp Compiler
"Analyizing Intpreter", I think. Byte compiling is (probably) slower
than expressing elisp in idomatic javascript. The intepretation
approach should also be less work.

** Keyboard Capture
*** Mouse Capture

** Buffers
*** Colors
