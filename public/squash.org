* Squash in-language JavaScript SQL
  by [[file:lang][Lang]] [2009-10-29 Thu]

  Squash is a JavaScript library for expressing SQL queries using
  syntax rather than string concatenation. The expression objects can
  be combined more easily than strings, and ensure that data is typed
  correctly.

  Squash is loosely modeled on LINQ, but is a great deal more limited
  at the moment. I developed it because I'm working in classic ASP and
  wanted a layer of reasonable abstraction to distance my code from
  the eccentric database layout imposed by the ORM.

  Squash depends on [[http://code.google.com/p/sprintf/][sprintf]] (for formatting the date type).
  Try [[file:javascript/squash.html][tests running in the browser]], and see the
  [[file:javascript/squash.js][squash code]].
