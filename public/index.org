* HT templates for Javascript, Emacs Lisp, and Scheme (Python coming soon)
** Motivation
*** Templates are safe, not just convenient
*** CSS selectors are compact and standard (props to HAML)
*** printf-style replacements give dynamic languages limited typing
*** Native lists; bringing unhygienic macros to the masses
** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC js2
ht(["html",
    ["head",
     ["title", "template test"]],
    ["body",
     ["div#container",
      ["h1#head", "a title"],
      ["p#text", "%s"]]]]);
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
ht('("html",
     ("head",
      ("title", "template test")),
     ("body",
      ("div#container",
       ("h1#head", "a title"),
       ("p#text", "%s")))))
#+END_SRC

*** TODO Emacs Lisp: [[ht/ht.el]]
*** TODO Javascript (also ASP Jscript): [[./ht/ht.js]]
    The javascript version should work, but it's limited and written
    weirdly. This was the first implementation, it uses regular
    expressions for parsing and is inflexible. A new version will
    follow when I've got the elisp parser right.

*** TODO Scheme: [[ht/ht.scm]]
