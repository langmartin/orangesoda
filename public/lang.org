* Cheat Sheets
** Emacs
   [2009-07-02 Thu]

   I just use this to keep a stack of things I've learned recently
   about emacs. I've only been using it for 8 years, so this happens
   all the time.

   - VC Annotate :: =C-x v g= for line-by-line history.
   - URL Encoding :: =org-link-unescape= and =org-link-escape=.
   - eshell pipe to buffer :: =diff > #<buffer *scratch*>=
   - iBuffer multi-occur :: =O= operates on tagged files. =I= for
        replace.
   - GNUS Gmail Search :: =G G= in the Group buffer. See
        [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusGmail#toc16][Gnus Gmail on Emacswiki]] for more detail.
   - GNUS Gmail Keeping in Sync :: [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusGmail#toc11][Catching Up]] on that same page.

** Firefox
   - =browser.tabs.closeButtons= :: 2 will hide the close buttons.
        More tab text real estate.
   - =browser.tabs.tabMinWidth= :: reduce from 100 to allow more tabs
        without the drop down.
   - =browser.sessionstore.interval= :: increase to fix choppy video
        (maybe not necessary > 3.5).
   - =extensions.checkCompatibility.3.6= :: create boolean false to
        enable extensions that aren't marked ready for the new
        version.
   - =mousewheel.withshiftkey.action= :: 0 to make it scroll
        horizontally.
   - =network.cookie.lifetime.days= :: expire all cookies in...
   - =network.cookie.lifetimePolicy= :: 3 to honor lifetime.days.

** Windows
   [2009-10-29 Thu]

** Fonts
   - [[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=22e69ae4-7e40-4807-8a86-b3d36fab68d3&displaylang=en][Consolas]] :: Nice monospace font if ClearType is on.
   - [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=DoulosSILfont][DoulosSIL]] :: missing unicode glyphs.

*** Install Flash Manually
   1. http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/xpi/current/flashplayer-win.xpi
   2. Rename to =.zip=
   3. Copy =NPSWF32.dll= and =flashplayer.xpt= to =Mozilla Firefox\plugins= [fn:plugins]
   4. Restart
   5. http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/plugincheck/

[fn:plugins] Firefox plugins can be installed either in the global
directory or in your =Application Data= directory, although a
=plugins= sub-folder might not exist. IE plugins (on XP) seem to go in
=system32\Macromed\Flash=.

*** Classic ASP Order of Evaluation
    by [[file:lang.org][Lang]]. [2009-07-17 Fri]

    Classic ASP supports a few different language platforms, although
    it seems rare to see anything other than VBScript and JScript. The
    order of evaluation is:

    0. The language tag.
    1. =<script>= tags in the non-default language.
    2. =<script>= tags in the default language.
    3. Static HTML and =<% %>= blocks in order.

    There are some restrictions on the type of data that can be passed
    between languages, but functions appear to be fair game. I've had
    success programming in JScript by leaving the default language
    alone and preparing thunks that produce output. I can call those
    thunks in the page as =<% foo_thunk %>=.

    I've had even better success dumping JSON to the client and keeping
    the HTML on the client side.
