Email lang.martin at Gmail.

I use Github to store repositories of most of my projects. My account
there is http://github.com/langmartin.

* Project Index
  - [[file:emacs.org][Emacs]] :: Code and notes.
  - [[file:windows.org][Windows Cheat Sheet]] :: I'm using Windows (XP) for the first time
       in years, I'm collecting notes as I go.
  - [[file:squash/index.org][Squash]] :: a JavaScript library for manipulating SQL queries.
  - [[file:jsmacs/index.org][JSMacs]] :: an early-stage, slow-moving attempt to get emacs lisp
              and emacs running in the browser.
  - [[http://github.com/weaver/sic][SIC]] :: Scheme Incremental Compiler.

* Ideas
** Chrome plugin: tab key focuses form elements
   http://github.com/decklin/yakshave/ is a comprehensive keyboard
   capture plugin; I'd like to make the tab key focus only form
   elements until you start searching for links.

** Emacs interface to Chrome Dev Tools
   [[http://code.google.com/p/chromedevtools/wiki/ChromeDevToolsProtocol][ChromeDevToolsProtocol]].

** Emacs interface to Google contacts
   I'd like to use the BBDB keys from Gnus against my Google contacts.

* Motorcycles
  I have a new (to me) 2005 Suzuki SV650. I spent this summer on 2006
  GZ250, which is a fine bike for commuting and crusing around town.
  It is also going to be for sale soon, so if you think you want a
  scooter, talk to me instead. The SV is better in the
  mountains[fn:1].

** Trips I like
   Ranked, ish. All near Chattanooga, TN.

   2. Tellico Plains has camping, and Erik reports that Hwy 165 off
      into the Cherokee National forest is awesome. Good fishing, too,
      apparently.

      So it turns out that this is where "the tail of the dragon" is,
      more or less. Check out the (just coined) [[http://goo.gl/maps/Zsra][Triple Bypass]]. Leg #2
      is the dragon.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] I'm aware that a sarcasm emoticon has been discussed on the
Internet, and generally rejected by folks with a respect for language.
In this case, it would be nice to be able to invoke a wry tone in
order to indicate the magnitude of this understatement. I've resorted
to a footnote, which is every bit as much an extra-lingual dodge as an
emoticon. :(
