#+TITLE: Lang Martin

Email lang.martin at Gmail. My [[file:lang/lang-martin.asc][public key]]. Most of my email is signed,
but only when I send it from Emacs.

I use Github to store repositories of most of my projects. My account
there is http://github.com/langmartin.

* Project Index
  - [[file:emacs.org][Emacs]] :: Code and notes.

* Ideas
** Chrome plugin: tab key focuses form elements
   http://github.com/decklin/yakshave/ is a comprehensive keyboard
   capture plugin; I'd like to make the tab key focus only form
   elements until you start searching for links.

** Emacs interface to Chrome Dev Tools
   [[http://code.google.com/p/chromedevtools/wiki/ChromeDevToolsProtocol][ChromeDevToolsProtocol]].

** Emacs interface to Google contacts
   I'd like to use the BBDB keys from Gnus against my Google contacts.

* Motorcycles
  I have a new (to me) 2005 Suzuki SV650. I spent this summer on 2006
  GZ250, which is a fine bike for commuting and crusing around town.
  It is also going to be for sale soon, so if you think you want a
  scooter, talk to me instead. The SV is better in the
  mountains[fn:1].

  I'm adding a new section on [[file:motorcycle/SV650.org][maintenance]].

* Footnotes

[fn:1] I'm aware that a sarcasm emoticon has been discussed on the
Internet, and generally rejected by folks with a respect for language.
In this case, it would be nice to be able to invoke a wry tone in
order to indicate the magnitude of this understatement. I've resorted
to a footnote, which is every bit as much an extra-lingual dodge as an
emoticon. :(
